# Platformer demo using GameJs #

This is a simple platformer game demo I put up to try GameJs features.
To those interested, [GameJs](http://gamejs.org/) is a javascript game library heavily inspired by [pygame](http://pygame.org/).

#### Gjs-Retarded
As it is a quite simple demo, I decided to use the _retarded_ version of the library, which doesn't rely on the backend server that is bundled with it.
For this reason, the modules here are a little bit different from the source of demos [here](http://gamejs.org/showcase/).
